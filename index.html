        <h2>My Buzz for Downhill</h2>
        
        <div><p>Couple of years ago I started riding my full suspension mountain bike around Rivington
          Pike and I loved the experience of riding the bike at the speeds of up to 90mph and going down
          the big drops I started to follow the UCI downhill World cup when I came across the Atherton
          which then I started to follow them on Facebook and Instagram and watching them seasons on Red Bull
          tv which given me the buzz to go out and buy a downhill mountain bike and try the downhill trails
          and I have been hooked ever since!</p></div>

       <div><p>I became a bit of a speed junkie!<br> I was a bit nerve-wrack when I when to my 
        frist Downhill trails which was Antur Stiniog in North Wales between Blaenan Ffestiniog 
         and Trawsfynydd.<br> Antur Stiniog has 14 trails that ranges from the green to black.</p></div>

        <div><p> The Green trail at Antur Stiniog are for the beginners which are 2KM of 
          flowing beautiful single tracks.<br> When I went I started on the green trail unitl 
          I got used to riding the trails, but as the day when on I had build up my confidence 
          to try the Blue trail Which is a series of berms twist you all the ways down.<br> I When
          on to the Red trail which you had more of a natural unsurfaced taril with plenty of 'airtime'
          <br>The jumps and berms that will lead you into 'Wildcart' which is really technical red trail 
          with the rocks aplenty some of the jump line with over 30 jumps which are all rollable 'Airtime'</p></div>
